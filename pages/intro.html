	This program performs calculations on small molecules or atomic clusters using ab initio techniques. It features a batch processor that reads geometries from quantum chemistry output files or generates them randomly. It then recalculates their energies on a Linux Cluster with MPI. This code was written to support global minimum searching and/or molecular dynamics calculations. Since performing such calculations efficiently in parallel is non-trivial, this code base is intended to simplify the process.

	The program uses XML which serves two purposes. First, it simplifies the input file, since XML can describe a complex request concisely. Second, the results are also stored in XML. In fact, the program's entire data structures can be written with XML which makes them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serializable</a>. This allows the program to more easily send messages between MPI processes. The program was written in C++ and uses a <a href="http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/">Rapid XML</a> parser which was designed for memory efficiency and speed.

	Thus far, the software can create input files for GAMESS-US, GAMESS-UK, Gaussian, and NWChem. It uses <a href="http://cclib.github.io/">cclib</a> to read output files in the following formats: ADF, Firefly, GAMESS-US, GAMESS-UK, Gaussian, Jaguar, Molpro, NWChem, ORCA, Psi, and QChem. This software represents a partial rewrite of the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/atomicglobalmin/">Atomic Global Minimum Locator</a>.
